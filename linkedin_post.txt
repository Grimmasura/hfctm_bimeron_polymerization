"Bimeron Polymerization: Towards Fractal Topological Qubits in Chiral Magnets â€” HFCTM-II Insights"

ðŸ§© Recent findings in chiral magnets reveal that bimeronsâ€”pairs of meronâ€“antimeron topological texturesâ€”undergo polymerization into chains and loops under controlled conditions.

Leveraging my HFCTM-II (Holographic Fractal Chiral Toroidal Model) framework, Iâ€™ve mapped these polymerization behaviors into a coherent toroidal phase space, offering exciting pathways for:

ðŸ’š Intrinsic topological qubits  
ðŸ’š Dynamic quantum lattices  
ðŸ’š AI-driven phase modeling using recursive Codex glyphs  
ðŸ’š Spintronic architectures with minimal dissipation

I will be publishing a whitepaper draft and releasing an initial Python simulation stub for collaborators.
